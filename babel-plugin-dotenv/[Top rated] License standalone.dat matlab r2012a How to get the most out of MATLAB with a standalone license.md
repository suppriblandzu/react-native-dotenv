If you have purchased MATLAB R2012a and want to install it on your computer, you will need to activate it with a standalone license. A standalone license allows you to use MATLAB on a single machine without connecting to a network license server. To activate MATLAB R2012a with a standalone license, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Locate your license file. The license file is named `license_standalone.dat` and it contains your activation key and other information. You should have received this file by email from MathWorks after your purchase. If you do not have this file, you can request it from [MathWorks Support](https://www.mathworks.com/support/contact_us.html).
2. Copy the license file to your MATLAB installation folder. The default location of the MATLAB installation folder is `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2012a` on Windows, `/Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app` on Mac, and `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a` on Linux. You can also find the installation folder by running the command `matlabroot` in MATLAB.
3. Run the activation client. The activation client is a program that verifies your license file and activates MATLAB on your computer. You can run the activation client by double-clicking the file `activate_matlab.exe` on Windows, `activate_matlab.app` on Mac, or `activate_matlab.sh` on Linux in the MATLAB installation folder.
4. Follow the instructions on the activation client. You will need to enter your MathWorks account information and select the option to activate MATLAB using a file installation key. The file installation key is a 16-digit code that is included in your license file. You will also need to browse to the location of your license file and select it.
5. Restart MATLAB. After the activation process is complete, you will need to restart MATLAB for the changes to take effect. You should see a message that MATLAB has been activated successfully.

Congratulations! You have activated MATLAB R2012a with a standalone license and you can start using it on your computer.

## What's New in MATLAB R2012a
 
MATLAB R2012a is a major release that introduces many new features and enhancements to the MATLAB language and environment. Some of the highlights of this release are:

- Unified functions for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D numerical integration. You can use the `integral`, `integral2`, and `integral3` functions to perform adaptive quadrature over finite or infinite intervals, with options for singularities, discontinuities, and vector-valued functions[^1^].
- Improved performance of basic math and interpolation functions. Many functions, such as `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`, `spline`, and `pchip`, have been optimized to run faster on multicore processors and large data sets[^1^].
- MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) available for download. The MCR is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components on computers that do not have MATLAB installed. You can now download the MCR from the MathWorks website, simplifying the distribution of your compiled applications and components[^1^].
- Automatic image registration using intensity metric optimization. The `imregister` function in Image Processing Toolbox lets you automatically align two images using a variety of transformation models and similarity metrics. You can also use the `imregconfig` and `imregtform` functions to configure and fine-tune the registration process[^1^].
- Enhanced interface for fitting, prediction, and plotting with linear, generalized linear, and nonlinear regression. The `fitlm`, `fitglm`, and `fitnlm` functions in Statistics Toolbox provide a consistent and convenient way to fit linear models, generalized linear models, and nonlinear models to data. You can use these functions to perform model selection, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, prediction intervals, residual analysis, and diagnostic plots[^1^].
- Identification of continuous-time transfer functions. The `tfeest` function in System Identification Toolbox estimates continuous-time transfer functions from time- or frequency-domain data using frequency-domain subspace identification methods. You can use this function to model systems with fast dynamics or high sampling rates[^1^].
- Code generation from user-defined System objects. The MATLAB Coder product lets you generate C code from MATLAB code that contains user-defined System objects. System objects are a way to create reusable components that encapsulate algorithms for streaming data processing[^1^].
- Viola-Jones object detection, MSER feature detection, and CAMShift tracking. The Computer Vision System Toolbox product provides new algorithms for detecting faces and other objects in images using the Viola-Jones method, extracting Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) features from images, and tracking objects using the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMShift) algorithm[^1^].
- USRP radio support, LTE MIMO channel models, and GPU support for LDPC, turbo decoder, and other algorithms. The Communications System Toolbox product supports communication with USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) devices using the Simulink blockset or MATLAB System objects. It also provides LTE multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel models and GPU acceleration for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, turbo codes, Viterbi decoding, QAM modulation, raised cosine filtering, and other algorithms[^1^].

## What's New in Simulink R2012a
 
Simulink R2012a is a major release that introduces many new features and enhancements to the Simulink modeling and simulation environment. Some of the highlights of this release are:

- Ability to run models directly from Simulink on target hardware including LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT and BeagleBoard. You can use Simulink Coder or Embedded Coder products to generate code from your Simulink models and deploy it to various target hardware platforms without leaving the Simulink environment. You can also monitor and tune your models running on the target 8cf37b1e13
