## The Plot of Hero
 
The film is told in Rashomon-style, with different versions of the same events narrated by different characters. The main plot revolves around Nameless (Jet Li), a prefect of a small province who claims to have killed three notorious assassins: Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung), who have been plotting to kill the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) for years.
 
Nameless is summoned by the King to receive his reward and tell his story. He explains how he used his skills and cunning to defeat each assassin in a series of duels. However, the King is skeptical and questions Nameless's motives and methods. He reveals his own version of the events, which contradicts Nameless's account. He accuses Nameless of being a spy for the assassins and part of their plan to get close to him.

Nameless then admits that the King is right and tells the true story, which involves a complex web of love, betrayal, sacrifice, and honor among the assassins. He reveals that he did not kill them, but instead convinced them to give up their mission for the sake of peace. He also confesses that he has come to kill the King himself, as he believes that he is a tyrant who oppresses the people.
 
The King then tells his own version of the true story, which shows his vision of unifying China under one rule and ending the chaos and war that have plagued the land for centuries. He challenges Nameless to kill him if he can, but also appeals to his sense of patriotism and humanity. He asks him to consider the consequences of his actions and the future of China.
 
The film ends with a climactic showdown between Nameless and the King, where Nameless has to make a fateful decision: to kill or not to kill.
  
## The Themes of Hero
 
Hero explores several themes that are relevant to both ancient and modern times. Some of these themes are:
 
- **Martial arts:** The film showcases various styles and techniques of martial arts, such as swordsmanship, archery, calligraphy, chess, and qi. The film also depicts martial arts as a form of art and expression, rather than just violence and combat. The duels between the characters are not only physical battles, but also philosophical debates and emotional exchanges.
- **Cinematography:** The film uses color as a symbolic device to differentiate between the different versions of the story. Each version has its own dominant color scheme that reflects the mood, tone, and perspective of the narrator. For example, Nameless's version is mostly red, representing blood, passion, and heroism; the King's version is mostly blue, representing coldness, rationality, and authority; and the true version is mostly white, representing purity, truth, and peace.
- **History:** The film is inspired by real historical events and figures from China's Warring States period (475-221 BC), which was a time of political turmoil and military conflict among seven states that vied for supremacy. The film portrays the King of Qin as a controversial figure who was both a ruthless conqueror and a visionary leader who unified China for the first time. The film also raises questions about the role of history and memory in shaping our 8cf37b1e13
