# How to Play Hitman Contracts on Windows 7 Without CD
 
Hitman Contracts is a stealth action game released in 2004 by IO Interactive. It is the third installment in the Hitman series, following the adventures of Agent 47, a genetically engineered assassin. The game features 12 missions set in various locations around the world, such as England, Russia, China, and France.
 
However, many players have reported problems with running Hitman Contracts on Windows 7, especially if they don't have the original CD. The game may not launch, crash, or display an error message. This is because the game uses an outdated copy protection system called SecuROM, which is incompatible with newer operating systems and may be blocked by antivirus software.

Fortunately, there is a simple solution to play Hitman Contracts on Windows 7 without CD. You just need to download and install a No-CD patch that will bypass the SecuROM check and allow you to run the game from your hard drive. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Make sure you have installed Hitman Contracts on your computer. You can use the original CD or a digital download from a reputable source.
2. Download the No-CD patch for Hitman Contracts from one of these links: [^1^] or [^2^]. These are trusted websites that provide game fixes and trainers. Make sure you choose the patch that matches your game version (v1.0 or v1.74).
3. Extract the No-CD patch file (usually a .zip or .rar archive) to a folder on your computer. You will see a file named HitmanContracts.exe or something similar.
4. Copy and paste the No-CD patch file to the folder where you installed Hitman Contracts, usually C:\Program Files\Hitman Contracts or C:\Program Files (x86)\Hitman Contracts. You will be asked to overwrite the existing file. Click Yes.
5. Run the No-CD patch file as administrator by right-clicking on it and choosing Run as administrator. This will launch Hitman Contracts without CD.

That's it! You can now enjoy playing Hitman Contracts on Windows 7 without CD. However, keep in mind that some antivirus software may flag the No-CD patch file as a virus or a trojan. This is a false positive, as the patch does not contain any malicious code. You can safely ignore or whitelist the file in your antivirus settings.

## Hitman Contracts Gameplay Tips
 
Hitman Contracts is a challenging game that requires patience, strategy, and creativity. You can approach each mission in different ways, depending on your preferred style and objectives. Here are some general tips to help you master the game and become a silent assassin:

- Use your map frequently to plan your moves, locate your targets, and avoid enemies. You can also use it to find points of interest, such as weapons, items, or disguises.
- Explore each level thoroughly and look for alternative routes, hidden passages, or useful objects. You may find shortcuts, vantage points, or opportunities to create distractions or accidents.
- Be careful with your actions and movements. Don't run, bump into people, or trespass into restricted areas unless you have a good reason. Try to blend in with your surroundings and act natural.
- Use disguises wisely. They can help you access certain areas or get close to your targets without arousing suspicion. However, some disguises are more effective than others, and some enemies may see through them if you act suspiciously or get too close.
- Use your weapons sparingly and discreetly. Guns are loud and messy, and may alert nearby enemies or ruin your rating. Use silenced weapons or melee weapons if possible, and hide the bodies afterwards. You can also use environmental objects, such as fire extinguishers, gas valves, or chandeliers, to kill your targets without leaving a trace.
- Save often and use multiple slots. You never know when something may go wrong or when you may want to try a different approach. You can also replay previous missions to improve your score or unlock new weapons.

Hitman Contracts is a game that rewards experimentation and improvisation. Don't be afraid to try different methods and strategies to complete your missions. You may discover new ways to eliminate your targets or achieve better ratings. Have fun and enjoy the game!
