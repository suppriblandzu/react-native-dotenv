The film also features Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing, a scientist who helps Cross escape from his pursuers, and Edward Norton as Eric Byer, the director of the CIA's Outcome program that created Cross and other agents like him.

The Bourne Legacy received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Renner's performance and the action sequences, but criticized the lack of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne character and the convoluted plot. The film was a box office success, grossing over $276 million worldwide against a budget of $125 million. A sequel, titled Jason Bourne, was released in 2016, featuring Damon's return as the titular character.

The Bourne Legacy is the fourth installment in the Bourne film series, which began with The Bourne Identity in 2002. The film is not based on any of the novels by Robert Ludlum, who died in 2001, but on an original story by Tony Gilroy. Gilroy had previously written the screenplays for the first three films, and also served as a producer and executive producer for them. He decided to direct The Bourne Legacy after Paul Greengrass, who directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, declined to return for a fourth film.

The film introduces a new protagonist, Aaron Cross, who is part of a secret CIA program called Outcome, which enhances the physical and mental abilities of its agents with experimental drugs. Cross is one of nine agents who are deployed around the world for various missions. However, when Jason Bourne exposes the Treadstone and Black Briar programs in The Bourne Ultimatum, the CIA decides to terminate Outcome and eliminate all of its agents. Cross manages to survive an assassination attempt in Alaska, where he meets Dr. Marta Shearing, a biochemist who works for Outcome.
 
Cross and Shearing form an unlikely alliance as they try to escape from the CIA's hunt. They travel to Shearing's house in Maryland, where they are attacked by another Outcome agent, LARX-03, who is sent by Byer to kill them. They manage to fend off LARX-03 and flee to Manila, where Shearing's former colleague works at a pharmaceutical company that produces the drugs for Outcome. They hope to find a way to make Cross's enhancements permanent, as he is running out of his supply of pills. However, they are pursued by both Byer's agents and local police, leading to a thrilling chase across the city.
