In this article, we will show you how to use Dhi 2009 Mike 11 Full Crack for river modeling in a few simple steps:
 
1. Download and install Dhi 2009 Mike 11 Full Crack from the link provided below. You will need a dongle emulator, patched, or cracked version to bypass the license verification.
2. Launch the MIKE Zero application and create a new project. Choose MIKE 11 as the modeling system and give your project a name and a location.
3. Define your river network by importing or creating a cross-section file (.xns11) and a network file (.nwk11). You can use the MIKE 11 Cross-section Editor and the MIKE 11 Network Editor tools to edit or create these files.
4. Select the simulation modules that you want to use for your river modeling. For example, you can choose the Hydrodynamic (HD) module for simulating water levels and flows, the Advection-Dispersion (AD) module for simulating water quality parameters, the Sediment Transport (ST) module for simulating bed load and suspended load transport, and so on.
5. Specify the input data and parameters for each simulation module. For example, you can define the boundary conditions, initial conditions, time step, simulation period, output options, hydrological data, water quality data, sediment data, etc.
6. Run the simulation and wait for it to finish. You can monitor the progress and check for errors or warnings in the MIKE Zero Message Window.
7. Analyze and visualize the simulation results using the MIKE Zero Result Viewer tool. You can plot graphs, maps, animations, profiles, tables, etc. of the output variables that you selected.

That's it! You have successfully used Dhi 2009 Mike 11 Full Crack for river modeling. You can now explore the results and compare them with other scenarios or models. You can also export or print the results for further use or presentation.

## Example 1: Flood Routing in a River Channel
 
In this example, we will use the HD module to simulate the flood routing in a river channel with a bridge and a weir. The river channel has a length of 10 km and a varying width and depth. The bridge is located at 5 km from the upstream boundary and has a width of 50 m and a height of 2 m. The weir is located at 7 km from the upstream boundary and has a width of 100 m and a height of 1 m. The upstream boundary condition is a hydrograph with a peak flow of 1000 m3/s at 12 hours. The downstream boundary condition is a constant water level of 5 m.
 
To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Open the MIKE Zero application and create a new project. Choose MIKE 11 as the modeling system and name your project "Flood Routing".
2. Import the cross-section file "FloodRouting.xns11" and the network file "FloodRouting.nwk11" from the MIKE 11 Examples folder.
3. Select the HD module and specify the input data and parameters as follows:
    - Boundary Conditions: Import the upstream hydrograph file "FloodRouting.qbn" and set the downstream water level to 5 m.
    - Initial Conditions: Set the initial water level to 5 m for all cross-sections.
    - Time Step: Set the time step to 60 seconds.
    - Simulation Period: Set the start time to 0 hours and the end time to 24 hours.
    - Output Options: Select the output variables that you want to save, such as water level, discharge, velocity, etc. You can also choose the output frequency and format.
4. Run the simulation and wait for it to finish.
5. Analyze and visualize the simulation results using the MIKE Zero Result Viewer tool. You can plot graphs of water level and discharge at different locations along the river channel, such as before and after the bridge and the weir. You can also plot maps of water level and velocity for different time steps. You can see how the flood wave propagates downstream and how it is affected by the bridge and the weir.

## Example 2: Water Quality in a River Network
 
In this example, we will use the HD and AD modules to simulate the water quality in a river network with two branches. The river network has a total length of 20 km and consists of two branches that join at a confluence. The upstream boundary conditions for both branches are constant flows of 10 m3/s and constant concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) of 8 mg/l. The downstream boundary condition is a constant water level of 10 m. There are two point sources of pollution along each branch that discharge organic matter (BOD) into the river network. The BOD decay rate is assumed to be 0.1 d-1.
 
To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Open the MIKE Zero application and create a new project. Choose MIKE 11 as the modeling system and name your project "Water Quality".
2. Import the cross-section file "WaterQuality.xns11" and the network file "WaterQuality.nwk11" from the MIKE 11 Examples folder.
3. Select the HD module and specify the input data and parameters as follows:
    - Boundary Conditions: Set the upstream flows to 10 m3/s for both branches and set the downstream water level to 10 m.
    - Initial Conditions: Set the initial water level to 10 m for all cross-sections.
    - Time Step: Set the time step to 60 seconds.
    - Simulation Period: Set the start time to 0 hours and the end time to 24 hours.
    - Output Options: Select the output variables that you want to save, such as water level, discharge, velocity, etc. You can also choose the output frequency and format.
4. Select the AD module and specify the input data and parameters as follows: 8cf37b1e13
