If you are a Pro Tools user who wants to use VST plugins in your projects, you might be interested in Sugar Bytes TransVST, a plugin wrapper that transforms VST plugins into AAX plugins. TransVST runs as a standalone program that offers a luxurious plugin management and integrates any VST plugin in Pro Tools, so that it can be used as a normal AAX plugin. TransVST is already 64-bit compatible and supports creative plugin functions like MIDI out, sidechaining and multi outputs.

Sugar Bytes TransVST was released in December 2013 by the German software company Sugar Bytes, which is known for its innovative and high-quality audio products. However, TransVST was discontinued shortly after its release due to legal issues with Avid, the developer of Pro Tools. According to R2R, a group of software crackers who managed to reverse engineer TransVST and release it for free, Avid took action against Sugar Bytes and forced them to stop selling TransVST.
 
Despite its short-lived official availability, TransVST has been widely praised by users who have tried it. Many users have reported that TransVST works better than FXpansion's VST to RTAS wrapper, which was the previous solution for using VST plugins in Pro Tools. TransVST is said to be more stable, faster and easier to use than FXpansion's wrapper. Users have also appreciated the ability to use VST plugins that have features that are not supported by RTAS or AAX plugins, such as MIDI out or multi outputs.
 
However, TransVST is not without its drawbacks. Some users have encountered compatibility issues with certain VST plugins or Pro Tools versions. Some users have also reported crashes or glitches when using TransVST. Moreover, TransVST is not officially supported by Sugar Bytes or Avid, so there is no guarantee that it will work with future updates of Pro Tools or VST plugins. Users who want to use TransVST do so at their own risk and responsibility.

In conclusion, Sugar Bytes TransVST is a plugin wrapper that allows Pro Tools users to use VST plugins as AAX plugins. It was released in 2013 but discontinued shortly after due to legal issues with Avid. It has been cracked and distributed by R2R for free. It has received positive feedback from users who have tried it, but it also has some limitations and risks. It is a useful tool for Pro Tools users who want to expand their plugin options, but it is not a perfect solution.
  
## How to Use TransVST
 
To use TransVST, you need to have Pro Tools 10 or higher installed on your computer, as well as the VST plugins that you want to use. You also need to download and install TransVST from a reliable source, such as R2R's website. TransVST is a standalone program that does not require installation, so you can run it from any folder on your computer.
 
When you launch TransVST, you will see a window with two tabs: VST Plugins and AAX Plugins. The VST Plugins tab shows all the VST plugins that are detected on your computer. You can use the search bar or the filter options to find the plugins that you want to use. To convert a VST plugin into an AAX plugin, you simply need to drag and drop it from the VST Plugins tab to the AAX Plugins tab. TransVST will create a new AAX plugin file in the same folder as the original VST plugin file.
 
Once you have converted all the VST plugins that you want to use, you can close TransVST and launch Pro Tools. You will find the converted AAX plugins in the plugin list under the category "Other". You can use them as normal AAX plugins in your projects. You can also use TransVST's AudioSuite feature to process audio files with VST plugins without having to insert them in a track.
 
## Tips and Tricks for Using TransVST
 
TransVST is a powerful and convenient tool for using VST plugins in Pro Tools, but it also has some limitations and risks that you should be aware of. Here are some tips and tricks for using TransVST effectively and safely:
 
- Before converting a VST plugin into an AAX plugin, make sure that it is compatible with TransVST. Some VST plugins may not work properly or cause crashes or glitches when converted. You can check the compatibility list on R2R's website or test the plugin with TransVST before using it in Pro Tools.
- After converting a VST plugin into an AAX plugin, do not move or delete the original VST plugin file. TransVST does not copy the VST plugin file, but only creates a wrapper file that links to it. If you move or delete the original VST plugin file, the converted AAX plugin file will not work.
- Do not convert too many VST plugins at once. TransVST may take some time to convert each plugin, depending on its size and complexity. Converting too many plugins at once may cause TransVST to freeze or crash. It is recommended to convert only a few plugins at a time and close and reopen TransVST between each batch.
- Do not rely on TransVST for critical projects. TransVST is not officially supported by Sugar Bytes or Avid, so there is no guarantee that it will work with future updates of Pro Tools or VST plugins. It is also possible that Avid may take legal action against users who use TransVST or R2R's cracked version of it. It is advisable to use TransVST only for personal or experimental purposes and not for professional or commercial projects.
