3d-io BonesPro v4.21 for 3ds Max is a sophisticated, yet intuitive, skinning plugin that allows you to use any type of geometry as bones. You can use splines, boxes, cylinders, or even custom objects as bones, and assign them to your character mesh with a simple drag-and-drop interface. You can also adjust the influence of each bone on the mesh with a visual weight painting tool, or use the automatic weight calculation feature that analyzes the geometry and assigns optimal weights based on proximity and volume.
 
One of the main advantages of 3d-io BonesPro v4.21 for 3ds Max is that it uses a proprietary algorithm called UltraMode, which produces high-quality skin deformations without the need for complex bone setups or additional modifiers. UltraMode automatically handles the skinning of joints, bends, twists, and bulges, and preserves the volume and shape of the mesh. You can also fine-tune the results with various parameters, such as stiffness, damping, bulge factor, and more.
 
Another great feature of 3d-io BonesPro v4.21 for 3ds Max is that it supports multiple skinning methods, such as linear, dual quaternion, spherical harmonic, or blended skinning. You can choose the best method for your character depending on the type of motion and deformation you want to achieve. You can also mix different methods on different parts of the body, or switch between them at any time with a simple click.
 
With 3d-io BonesPro v4.21 for 3ds Max, you can also take advantage of some useful tools and functions that will make your skinning process easier and faster. For example, you can use the Skin Relax tool to smooth out any unwanted wrinkles or creases on the mesh surface. You can also use the Skin Copy tool to transfer skin weights from one mesh to another with different topology or resolution. You can also export and import skin weights as text files, or save them as presets for future use.
