## Step 1: Importing and Organizing Clips
 
To import clips into Canopus Edius Pro 5, you can either use the Capture tool to capture video from a camera or a device, or use the Bin window to browse and import files from your computer. You can also drag and drop files from Windows Explorer into the Bin window. The Bin window allows you to organize your clips into folders and subfolders, rename them, add comments and ratings, and view their properties and thumbnails.
 
To edit your clips, you need to add them to the Timeline window, which is where you can arrange them in tracks, trim them, split them, and apply effects and transitions. You can drag and drop clips from the Bin window to the Timeline window, or use the Insert or Overwrite buttons to add them at the current position of the cursor. You can also use the Source Browser tool to preview and mark in and out points of your clips before adding them to the timeline.
 
## Step 2: Editing Clips on the Timeline
 
Once you have added your clips to the timeline, you can use various tools and commands to edit them. You can use the Selection tool to select one or more clips and move them around, or use the Ripple Edit tool to trim them without affecting the rest of the timeline. You can also use the Slip tool to change the in and out points of a clip without changing its duration or position, or use the Slide tool to change the position of a clip without changing its duration or affecting other clips.
 
To apply effects and filters to your clips, you can use the Information Palette window, which shows all the properties and attributes of a selected clip. You can adjust parameters such as opacity, speed, volume, color correction, and more. You can also add key frames to animate these parameters over time. To add transitions between clips, you can use the Transition Palette window, which offers a variety of transition types such as dissolves, wipes, slides, flips, and more. You can customize the duration and direction of each transition and preview it in the Preview window.
 
## Step 3: Exporting Your Project
 
When you are done editing your project, you can export it in various formats and resolutions. You can use the Print to File tool to export your project as a video file that you can play on your computer or upload online. You can choose from different presets or customize your own settings for codec, frame size, frame rate, bitrate, audio format, and more. You can also use the Batch Export tool to export multiple projects or sequences at once.
 
If you want to burn your project to a DVD or Blu-ray disc, you can use the Disc Burner tool. This tool allows you to create menus and chapters for your disc, choose from different templates or design your own layout, and preview your disc before burning it. You can also choose from different disc formats such as DVD-Video, DVD-VR, AVCHD, or Blu-ray.
 
Canopus Edius Pro 5 is a powerful and versatile editing software that can help you create professional-looking video projects with ease. With its seamless handling of mixed formats, real-time editing capabilities, and rich feature set, Canopus Edius Pro 5 is a great choice for any video editor.
