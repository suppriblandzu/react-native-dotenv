- Use a low ISO setting. The lower your ISO setting on your camera, the less noise your picture will have. HDR photography is notorious for creating noise and images that appear grainy. Although you can fix some of this in post-processing, itâs easier to use a lower ISO to begin with[^4^].
- Use a tripod. A tripod is essential for HDR photography, as it ensures that your camera stays steady and aligned for each exposure. Any slight movement or misalignment can cause ghosting or blurring in your final image. A tripod also allows you to use slower shutter speeds without worrying about camera shake.
- Use a cable release or a remote control. To avoid any camera shake or vibration, itâs best to use a cable release or a remote control to trigger your shutter. This way, you donât have to touch your camera at all and risk moving it slightly between exposures.
- Use aperture priority mode. Aperture priority mode allows you to set the aperture value and let the camera choose the shutter speed automatically. This way, you can control the depth of field and ensure that all your exposures have the same focus and sharpness. The camera will adjust the shutter speed accordingly to create different exposures.
- Use exposure bracketing. Exposure bracketing is a feature that lets you take multiple photos with different exposures automatically. You can set the number of shots, the exposure value (EV) difference, and the order of the shots. For example, you can set your camera to take three shots with -2 EV, 0 EV, and +2 EV difference in that order. This will give you a range of exposures that cover the highlights and shadows of your scene.
- Use InPixio Eclipse HDR PRO to merge and edit your photos. Once you have your bracketed photos, you can import them into InPixio Eclipse HDR PRO and let it do the magic. The software will automatically align and merge your photos into one HDR image. You can then choose from various presets or adjust the settings manually to achieve your desired look.

By following these tips, you can create stunning HDR photos with InPixio Eclipse HDR PRO that will impress your viewers and showcase your creativity.
