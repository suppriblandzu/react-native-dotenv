## Benefits of Using Equation Editor 3.0
 
Despite being discontinued by Microsoft, Equation Editor 3.0 still has some benefits for creating and editing mathematical equations in Microsoft Office documents. Some of these benefits are:

- Equation Editor 3.0 is compatible with older versions of Microsoft Office, such as Office 2003 and Office 2007. This means that you can still use it to edit equations that were created with these versions.
- Equation Editor 3.0 allows you to create equations that are not supported by the newer built-in equation tools in Microsoft Office, such as matrices, integrals, fractions, and radicals.
- Equation Editor 3.0 does not require any rekeying by the typesetter when you submit your document for publication. This reduces the possibility of introducing errors and saves time and money. For example, Wiley is able to convert the equations created with Equation Editor 3.0 to MathML for inclusion in their XML-based digital products[^1^].

## Alternatives to Equation Editor 3.0
 
If you are looking for alternatives to Equation Editor 3.0 that are more secure and up-to-date, you may want to consider the following options:

- The built-in equation tools in Microsoft Office 2010 or later. These tools allow you to insert and edit equations using a graphical interface or a keyboard shortcut. You can also use the Ink Equation feature to write equations with a stylus or your finger on a touch screen device.
- MathType. This is a third-party software that integrates with Microsoft Office and other applications. It allows you to create and edit equations using a graphical interface or a keyboard shortcut. It also supports more features and formats than Equation Editor 3.0, such as TeX, LaTeX, MathML, and HTML.
- LaTeX. This is a document preparation system that is widely used for scientific and technical writing. It allows you to create and edit equations using a markup language that is similar to HTML. It also supports more features and formats than Equation Editor 3.0, such as TeX, MathType, MathML, and PDF.
