OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion is the ninth major release of Apple's desktop operating system for Mac computers. It was released in July 2012 and introduced new features such as iCloud integration, Notification Center, Gatekeeper, and Messages. If you want to try out this operating system without buying a Mac or upgrading your existing one, you can install it as a guest operating system on VMware Workstation, a virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single PC.

In this article, we will show you how to install OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion on VMware Workstation using a retail VMware image that you can download from the Internet Archive. This image is compatible with both AMD and Intel processors and has VMware Tools pre-installed. However, before you proceed, you need to make sure that you have the following requirements:
 
- A PC with a 64-bit processor and at least 4 GB of RAM.
- VMware Workstation 8 or higher installed on your PC.
- An unlocker tool that enables VMware Workstation to support Mac OS X guest operating systems.
- The OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Retail VMware Image file (about 4.3 GB) downloaded from [here](https://archive.org/details/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-soul-dev-team).

Once you have all the requirements, follow these steps to install OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion on VMware Workstation:

1. Extract the OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Retail VMware Image file using a file archiver such as 7-Zip or WinRAR. You should get a folder named "OS X Mountain Lion" that contains several files, including a .vmx file and a .vmdk file.
2. Run the unlocker tool as an administrator and follow the instructions to patch your VMware Workstation. This will allow you to create and run Mac OS X virtual machines.
3. Open VMware Workstation and click on "Open a Virtual Machine". Browse to the "OS X Mountain Lion" folder and select the .vmx file. Click "Open".
4. Edit the virtual machine settings according to your preferences. For example, you can increase the memory size, processor cores, or hard disk size. You can also change the network adapter to NAT or Bridged mode if you want to access the Internet from the virtual machine.
5. Power on the virtual machine and wait for it to boot up. You should see the Apple logo and a progress bar.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion virtual machine. You will need to agree to the license agreement, select a language, create a user account, and configure some settings.
7. Congratulations! You have successfully installed OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion on VMware Workstation. You can now enjoy using this operating system on your PC.

Note: Do not update your OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion virtual machine as it may cause it to stop working. Also, some features of VMware Tools may not work properly in this virtual machine, such as Unity mode, Mirrored folders, 3D acceleration, Bluetooth passthrough, or USB 3.0 support.
